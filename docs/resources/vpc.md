  apikey = var.cloudamqp_customer_api_key
}

# Managed VPC resource
resource "cloudamqp_vpc" "vpc" {
  name = "<VPC name>"
  region = "amazon-web-services::us-east-1"
  subnet = "10.56.72.0/24"
  tags = []
}

#  New instance, need to be created with a vpc
resource "cloudamqp_instance" "instance" {
  name   = "<Instance name>"
  plan   = "bunny-1"
  region = "amazon-web-services::us-east-1"
  nodes  = 1
  tags   = []
  rmq_version = "3.9.13"
  vpc_id = cloudamq_vpc.vpc.id
}

# Additional VPC information
data "cloudamqp_vpc_info" "vpc_info" {
  vpc_id = cloudamqp_vpc.vpc.id
}
```
