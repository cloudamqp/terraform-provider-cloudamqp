# cloudamqp_extra_disk_size

This resource allows you to expand the disk with additional storage capacity. There is no downtime when expanding the disk.

Only available for dedicated subscription plans hosted at Amazon Web Services (AWS) at this time.

⚠️  Due to restrictions from cloud providers, it's only possible to resize the disk every 8 hours.

Pricing is available at [cloudamqp.com](https://www.cloudamqp.com/).
